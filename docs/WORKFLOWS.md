## Overview

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD). Workflows are organized by build package (service/application), with each workflow handling:

- **Code Linting & Quality Checks**: Language-specific static analysis
- **Security Scanning**: Dependencies, code vulnerabilities, container images
- **Unit Testing**: Component-level testing with mocked external dependencies
- **Build & Push**: Multi-architecture Docker image builds (AMD64, ARM64)
- **Automated Versioning**: Semantic versioning with epoch64 timestamps
- **Pre-Release Creation**: Automatic GitHub pre-release generation on version changes

**Key Philosophy**: All workflows are optimized for **speed, reliability, and security**. Path filters ensure workflows only run when relevant files change, saving CI/CD resources.

---

## Workflow Architecture

### Pipeline Structure

Each build package has a dedicated workflow file following this structure:

```
┌──────────────┐
│ Lint Stage   │ (Fail fast on code quality issues)
└───────┬──────┘
        │
        ▼
┌──────────────┐
│ Test Stage   │ (Unit tests only, mocked dependencies)
└───────┬──────┘
        │
        ▼
┌──────────────────────┐
│ Build & Push Stage   │ (Docker image build for multi-arch)
└───────┬──────────────┘
        │
        ▼
┌──────────────────────┐
│ Security Scan Stage  │ (Trivy container scan, CodeQL)
└──────────────────────┘
```

### Job Dependencies

- **Lint** → Runs immediately on push/PR
- **Test** → Requires lint to pass (fails fast on quality)
- **Build** → Requires both lint and test to pass
- **Security Scan** → Runs after build on push to registr

### When Workflows Trigger

Workflows trigger when:
1. Code changes in the build package directory
2. `.version` file changes (ensures version updates trigger all builds)
3. The workflow file itself changes
4. Manual trigger via `workflow_dispatch`

**Branches**: Main workflow triggers on `main` and `develop` branches. Pull requests trigger on `main` branch only.

---

## Build Packages & Services

### What is a Build Package?

A build package is a single, independently deployable service or application. For containerized services, the build package includes builds for multiple architectures:

- `linux/amd64` - Intel/AMD 64-bit servers
- `linux/arm64` - ARM 64-bit (Apple Silicon, Graviton, etc.)

### Project Services

**Project Template** includes three services:

| Service | Directory | Dockerfile | Architectures | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-----------|---------------|-------|
| flask-backend | `services/flask-backend/` | `services/flask-backend/Dockerfile` | amd64, arm64 | Python 3.13, Flask, PyDAL |
| go-backend | `services/go-backend/` | `services/go-backend/Dockerfile` | amd64, arm64 | Go 1.23, high-performance networking |
| webui | `services/webui/` | `services/webui/Dockerfile` | amd64, arm64 | Node.js 18+, React frontend |

### Workflow Files

Each service has a corresponding workflow file:

```
.github/workflows/
├── build-flask-backend.yml    # Flask backend build pipeline
├── build-go-backend.yml       # Go backend build pipeline
├── build-webui.yml            # WebUI build pipeline
└── version-release.yml        # Version-based pre-release creation
```

---

## Naming Conventions

### Overview

Image naming follows strict patterns based on:
1. **Build trigger type**: Code change or version change
2. **Branch**: Main branch vs development branches
3. **Release**: Official release tags

### Pattern Reference

#### Regular Builds (No Version Change)

When code changes but `.version` file doesn't change:

**Main Branch**:
```
image-name:beta-<epoch64>
```
Example: `my-service:beta-1702000000`

**Development Branches** (develop, feature/*, etc):
```
image-name:alpha-<epoch64>
```
Example: `my-service:alpha-1702000000`

#### Version Builds (Version Change)

When `.version` file changes (indicates intentional version bump):

**Main Branch**:
```
image-name:vX.X.X-beta
```
Example: `my-service:v1.2.3-beta`

**Development Branches**:
```
image-name:vX.X.X-alpha
```
Example: `my-service:v1.2.3-alpha`

#### Release Tags (Official Releases)

When pushing a release tag (`v*`):
```
image-name:vX.X.X      # Primary release version
image-name:latest      # Latest release pointer
```
Example: `my-service:v1.2.3` and `my-service:latest`

### Naming Explanation

| Pattern | When Used | Example | Purpose |
|---------|-----------|---------|---------|
| `beta-<epoch64>` | Code change on main | `beta-1702000000` | Track beta builds, know exact build time |
| `alpha-<epoch64>` | Code change on develop | `alpha-1702000000` | Track development snapshots |
| `vX.X.X-beta` | Version change on main | `v1.2.3-beta` | Pre-release version tracking |
| `vX.X.X-alpha` | Version change on develop | `v1.2.3-alpha` | Development version tracking |
| `vX.X.X` | Official release | `v1.2.3` | Stable release version |
| `latest` | Latest stable | `latest` | Always points to newest release |

### Epoch64 Timestamp

The `<epoch64>` value is the Unix timestamp (seconds since January 1, 1970 UTC) at build time.

- **Generation**: `date +%s` produces the epoch timestamp
- **Uniqueness**: Each build has a unique timestamp
- **Sortability**: Timestamps sort chronologically
- **Example**: `1702000000` = November 8, 2023, 7:26:40 PM UTC

**Benefits**:
- Know exactly when an image was built
- Identify which exact code is running in production
- Trace issues to specific points in time
- Unique identification without human naming

### Version File Format

The `.version` file contains semantic versioning:

```
X.Y.Z
```

Where:
- **X**: Major version (breaking changes, API changes)
- **Y**: Minor version (new features, backward compatible)
- **Z**: Patch version (bug fixes, patches)

Example: `1.2.3`

**Update Commands**:
```bash
# Increment patch (bug fix)
echo "1.2.4" > .version

# Increment minor (new feature)
echo "1.3.0" > .version

# Increment major (breaking change)
echo "2.0.0" > .version
```

## Path Filter Requirements

### Why Path Filters Matter

Path filters optimize CI/CD by:
- **Reducing build time**: Don't rebuild unrelated services
- **Saving costs**: Fewer GitHub Actions minutes used
- **Faster feedback**: Developers get results quicker
- **Isolation**: Changes in one service don't trigger others

### Standard Path Filter Pattern

Every build workflow must include these paths:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
    paths:
      - 'services/[service-name]/**'    # Service code
      - '.version'                       # Critical: trigger on version changes
      - '.github/workflows/build-[service-name].yml'  # Workflow itself
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
    paths:
      - 'services/[service-name]/**'
      - '.version'
      - '.github/workflows/build-[service-name].yml'
```

### Critical: .version in All Path Filters

**IMPORTANT**: The `.version` file MUST be in path filters for all build workflows. This ensures:

1. **Triggered Rebuilds**: When version changes, all services rebuild
2. **Consistent Versioning**: All images from same commit have same version
3. **Release Automation**: Pre-releases only trigger for intentional version bumps
4. **Audit Trail**: Clear separation between code changes and version bumps

### Path Filter Examples

**Good ✅**:
```yaml
paths:
  - 'services/flask-backend/**'
  - '.version'
  - '.github/workflows/build-flask-backend.yml'
```

**Bad ❌** (Missing .version):
```yaml
paths:
  - 'services/flask-backend/**'
  - '.github/workflows/build-flask-backend.yml'
```

**Bad ❌** (Paths too broad):
```yaml
paths:
  - 'services/**'  # Triggers for ALL services
  - '**'           # Triggers for everything
```

### Shared Code Path Filters

If services share code (e.g., in `shared/` directory), include it:

```yaml
paths:
  - 'services/[service-name]/**'
  - 'shared/**'                      # Add if shared code is used
  - '.version'
  - '.github/workflows/build-[service-name].yml'
```

## Security Scanning

### Overview

Each workflow includes multiple security checks:

1. **Dependency Scanning**: Language-specific audits for vulnerable packages
2. **Code Analysis**: Language-specific linting and security rules
3. **Container Scanning**: Trivy vulnerability scanner for Docker images
4. **Secret Scanning**: Detect accidentally committed secrets (GitHub native)

### Language-Specific Security Checks

#### Python Services (Flask)

**Bandit** - Scans for common Python security issues:

```yaml
- name: Run bandit security check
  working-directory: services/flask-backend
  run: bandit -r app -ll
```

Fails on `HIGH` or `CRITICAL` severity only (allows `MEDIUM` and `LOW`).

**Additional Checks**:
- Linting: `flake8`, `black`, `isort`
- Type checking: `mypy` for type safety
- Dependency audit: `safety check` for vulnerable packages

#### Go Services

**gosec** - Scans for Go security issues:

```yaml
- name: Run gosec security scanner
  uses: securecodewarrior/github-action-gosec@master
  with:
    args: '-severity high -confidence medium ./...'
```

Fails on `HIGH` or `CRITICAL` severity.

**Additional Checks**:
- Linting: `golangci-lint` (includes gosec rules)
- Dependency audit: `go mod audit`

#### Node.js Services (React, WebUI)

**npm audit** - Scans npm dependencies:

```yaml
- name: Run npm audit
  working-directory: services/webui
  run: npm audit --audit-level=high
```

Fails on `HIGH` or `CRITICAL` severity vulnerabilities.

**Additional Checks**:
- Linting: `eslint`, `prettier`
- Dependency tracking: Dependabot alerts

### Container Scanning

**Trivy** - Scans built Docker images:

```yaml
- name: Run Trivy vulnerability scanner
  uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
  with:
    image-ref: ${{ env.REGISTRY }}/${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}:${{ github.sha }}
    format: 'sarif'
    output: 'trivy-results.sarif'
```

- Scans for known vulnerabilities in base image and installed packages
- Results uploaded to GitHub Security tab
- Does not fail build (allows informational scanning)

### CodeQL Analysis

GitHub's CodeQL performs automatic code analysis:

- Detects common code patterns that could be exploited
- Runs on all push events to main/develop
- Results visible in Security tab → Code scanning alerts
- Fails if critical issues found (configurable)

### Security Scanning Order

Best practice execution order:

1. **Linting** (first - cheapest, fast feedback)
   - `flake8`, `black`, `isort` (Python)
   - `golangci-lint` (Go)
   - `eslint`, `prettier` (Node.js)

2. **Dependency Audits** (second - catch vulnerable packages)
   - `bandit`, `safety check` (Python)
   - `gosec`, `go mod audit` (Go)
   - `npm audit` (Node.js)

3. **Unit Tests** (third - verify functionality)
   - `pytest` (Python)
   - `go test` (Go)
   - `jest` (Node.js)

4. **Build** (fourth - create artifacts)
   - Docker image build with multi-arch support

5. **Container Scan** (fifth - scan final image)
   - Trivy vulnerability scanner

### Security Alert Response

If a security check fails:

1. **Do not commit** if security vulnerabilities are found
2. **Fix vulnerabilities immediately**:
   - Update vulnerable dependencies
   - Fix code issues flagged by security scanners
   - Address container vulnerabilities
3. **Re-run checks** locally before commit:
   - `cd services/[service] && npm run lint` or equivalent
   - `cd services/[service] && npm run security` or equivalent
4. **Document fixes** in commit message if security-related

## Version Release Workflow

### Overview

The `version-release.yml` workflow automatically creates GitHub pre-releases when `.version` file changes on the main branch.

### Workflow Behavior

**Trigger**: `.version` file change on `main` branch

**Actions**:
1. Read `.version` file and extract semantic version
2. Check if version is not default (0.0.0)
3. Check if release already exists
4. Generate release notes from commit history
5. Create GitHub pre-release with auto-generated notes
6. Skip if version is 0.0.0 or release already exists

### Release Lifecycle

```
Developer updates .version file
         │
         ▼
        Commit on main branch
         │
         ▼
       Push to GitHub
         │
         ▼
version-release.yml triggers
         │
         ├─→ Extract version from .version file
         │
         ├─→ Check if 0.0.0 (skip if true)
         │
         ├─→ Check if release exists (skip if true)
         │
         └─→ Create pre-release with notes
         │
         ▼
GitHub pre-release created & visible
```

### Manual Release Creation

If pre-release workflow doesn't create release:

```bash
# From project root with .version file
VERSION=$(cat .version)
gh release create "v$VERSION" \
  --title "v$VERSION" \
  --notes "Release notes here" \
  --prerelease
```

### Converting Pre-Release to Release

To convert pre-release to full release:

```bash
# Mark as final release (remove pre-release flag)
gh release edit "vX.X.X" --prerelease=false
```

### Build Workflow Interaction

Build workflows (build-[service].yml) interact with version-release.yml:

1. **Regular code change** → Build workflow triggers → `beta-<epoch64>` or `alpha-<epoch64>` tags
2. **Version change** → Build workflow triggers AND version-release workflow triggers
   - Build workflow: Creates `vX.X.X-beta` or `vX.X.X-alpha` images
   - Version-release: Creates GitHub pre-release

---

## Build Optimization

### Multi-Architecture Builds

All Docker builds target multiple architectures:

```yaml
platforms: linux/amd64,linux/arm64
```

This creates images for:
- **linux/amd64**: Intel/AMD 64-bit servers
- **linux/arm64**: Apple Silicon, AWS Graviton, ARM servers

Benefits:
- Single image works across architectures
- Automatic architecture selection when pulling
- Future-proof for ARM adoption

### GitHub Actions Cache

Builds use GitHub Actions cache for faster builds:

```yaml
cache-from: type=gha
cache-to: type=gha,mode=max
```

**How it works**:
- First build: Takes full time, stores cache
- Subsequent builds: Reuse cached layers (often 50-80% faster)
- Cache includes: Base image, dependencies, intermediate steps

### Docker Build Caching Strategy

**Layer caching order** (from slowest to fastest to change):

1. **Base image** (rarely changes) → Cached longest
2. **System dependencies** (change occasionally) → Medium cache
3. **Application dependencies** (change per commit) → Regular cache
4. **Application code** (always changes) → Not cached

Dockerfile best practices for caching:

```dockerfile
# Good - dependencies before code
FROM debian:12-slim
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3 pip
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt    # Cached unless requirements change
COPY . /app                             # Only invalidates if app code changes

# Bad - invalidates cache on every code change
FROM debian:12-slim
COPY . /app
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3 pip
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Path-Based Execution

Workflows only run when relevant paths change:

```yaml
paths:
  - 'services/flask-backend/**'  # Only run if Flask backend changes
  - '.version'                    # Only run if version changes
  - '.github/workflows/build-flask-backend.yml'
```

**Example savings**:
- 10 services, 1 changes → Run 1 workflow instead of 10
- Each workflow: 5-15 minutes → Save 45-135 minutes CI time
- 20 commits/day × 18 projects → Save hours of CI time daily

### Build Optimization Checklist

- ✅ Multi-architecture builds enabled (amd64, arm64)
- ✅ GitHub Actions cache enabled
- ✅ Path filters configured correctly
- ✅ Dockerfile layers optimized for caching
- ✅ Minimal base images (Debian slim, not Alpine)
- ✅ Multi-stage builds if applicable
- ✅ Unused dependencies removed

## Local Testing

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have:

```bash
# Docker for building/running containers
docker --version          # Docker 24+
docker-compose --version  # Docker Compose 2+

# Language runtimes
python --version          # 3.13+ for Python services
go version                # 1.23+ for Go services
node --version            # 18+ for Node.js services
```

### Testing Before Commit

**Always run these checks locally before committing**:

```bash
# 1. Linting (catches code quality issues first)
cd services/[service-name]
npm run lint           # For Node.js services
# OR
python -m flake8 .     # For Python services
# OR
golangci-lint run      # For Go services

# 2. Security checks (catches vulnerable dependencies)
npm audit --audit-level=high      # Node.js
python -m safety check            # Python
go mod audit                       # Go
bandit -r .                        # Python

# 3. Unit tests (verify functionality)
npm test               # Node.js
pytest                 # Python
go test ./...          # Go

# 4. Build locally
docker-compose build [service-name]

# 5. Run locally
docker-compose up [service-name]
```

### Local Docker Compose Testing

Test entire stack locally:

```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up

# In another terminal, test endpoints
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health      # Flask backend
curl http://localhost:3000/                # React UI
curl http://localhost:8080/health          # Go backend (if present)

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f [service-name]

# Stop all services
docker-compose down
```

### Common Testing Patterns

#### Python Service Testing

```bash
cd services/flask-backend

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run linting
flake8 app
black --check app
isort --check-only app

# Run security check
bandit -r app -ll

# Run tests
pytest --cov=app

# Build Docker image
docker build -t my-service:test .
```

#### Go Service Testing

```bash
cd services/go-backend

# Download dependencies
go mod download

# Run linting
golangci-lint run

# Run tests
go test -v -race ./...

# Build binary
go build -o my-service main.go

# Build Docker image
docker build -t my-service:test .
```

#### Node.js Service Testing

```bash
cd services/webui

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run linting
npm run lint

# Run security audit
npm audit --audit-level=high

# Run tests
npm test

# Build
npm run build

# Build Docker image
docker build -t my-service:test .
```

### Troubleshooting Local Tests

**Issue**: `Port already in use`
```bash
# Find process using port
lsof -i :5000

# Kill process or change docker-compose port
docker-compose down  # Stop running containers
```

**Issue**: `Module not found` / `Package not found`
```bash
# Reinstall dependencies
rm -rf node_modules && npm install    # Node.js
rm -rf venv && python -m venv venv    # Python
go clean -modcache && go mod download # Go
```

**Issue**: `Docker image build fails`
```bash
# Check Dockerfile syntax
docker build -t test:latest --no-cache services/[service]

# View detailed build output
docker build --progress=plain -t test:latest services/[service]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Workflow Execution Issues

#### Workflow Doesn't Trigger

**Problem**: Pushed code but workflow didn't run

**Causes & Solutions**:

1. **Branch not configured**:
   - Check `.version` path is in path filter
   - Verify branch is `main` or `develop`
   - Workflow only triggers on configured branches

2. **Path filter excludes change**:
   - Path filters prevent workflow from running
   - Verify file changed matches path pattern:
     ```yaml
     paths:
       - 'services/myservice/**'  # Only matches files under this path
     ```
   - If file is outside path, workflow won't trigger

3. **Syntax error in workflow file**:
   - GitHub will show error in Actions tab
   - Check workflow YAML syntax with online validator
   - Common: Missing quotes, incorrect indentation

**Fix**:
```bash
# Verify workflow file syntax
curl -X POST https://api.github.com/repos/[owner]/[repo]/actions/workflows/build-service.yml/validate \
  -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  -d @build-service.yml

# Or use local validator
yamllint .github/workflows/build-service.yml
```

#### Build Fails Unexpectedly

**Problem**: Build passed locally but fails in GitHub Actions

**Common Causes**:

1. **Environment variable missing**:
   - GitHub Actions doesn't have local environment vars
   - Set in workflow or in GitHub repository secrets
   - Access with `${{ secrets.VAR_NAME }}`

2. **Permissions missing**:
   - Token doesn't have required permissions
   - Check `permissions:` section in workflow
   - May need to adjust GitHub Actions token permissions

3. **Dependency version mismatch**:
   - Local: Specific version of Go/Python/Node installed
   - GitHub: May use different version
   - Use `setup-go@v5` / `setup-python@v5` with specific versions

4. **File not found in container**:
   - Dockerfile copies wrong path
   - Check working directory in Dockerfile
   - Verify COPY commands use correct paths

**Debug steps**:
```bash
# View full build output
# GitHub Actions → [Workflow] → [Run] → Click job to expand

# Test in container locally
docker run -it my-service:test /bin/bash
# Verify files exist, permissions correct, etc.

# Check environment variables
echo $PATH
echo $GOROOT
env | grep -i python
```

#### Security Scan Failures

**Problem**: Bandit/gosec/npm audit fails the build

**Solutions**:

1. **Vulnerable dependency found**:
   ```bash
   # Update dependencies
   pip install --upgrade [package]  # Python
   go get -u ./...                  # Go
   npm update                       # Node.js

   # Or explicitly set version
   pip install [package]==X.Y.Z
   go get [package]@vX.Y.Z
   npm install [package]@X.Y.Z
   ```

2. **False positive/acceptable risk**:
   ```bash
   # Suppress specific check (use sparingly)
   # Python
   bandit -r app -ll --exclude B101,B601

   # Go
   gosec -no-tests -exclude=G104 ./...

   # Node.js - Usually no suppression, fix dependencies
   ```

3. **Check what's failing**:
   ```bash
   # Run locally to see details
   cd services/[service]
   npm audit             # Shows all vulnerabilities
   bandit -r app -v      # Verbose output
   gosec -fmt=json ./... # JSON output for parsing
   ```

### Container Build Issues

#### Docker Build Fails

**Problem**: `docker build` fails locally

**Common errors**:

1. **Base image not found**:
   ```dockerfile
   FROM python:3.13-slim  # OK
   FROM python:3.13      # Not slim (larger image)
   FROM pyrhon:3.13      # Typo!
   ```
   **Solution**: Use valid image names, prefer slim variants

2. **Dependencies not installed**:
   ```dockerfile
   COPY requirements.txt .
   RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
   COPY . /app              # Must copy after install
   WORKDIR /app
   CMD ["python", "app.py"]
   ```

3. **File not found during COPY**:
   ```dockerfile
   COPY setup.py /app/  # File doesn't exist = build fails
   ```
   **Solution**: Check file exists before COPY, verify paths

4. **Port binding conflicts**:
   ```yaml
   # docker-compose.yml
   ports:
     - "5000:5000"  # Host:Container - if 5000 in use, fails
   ```
   **Solution**: `docker-compose down` or change port

**Debug**:
```bash
# Build with verbose output
docker build --progress=plain --no-cache -t test . 2>&1 | tail -50

# Inspect partially built image
docker build -t test . || docker run -it [image-id] /bin/bash
```

#### Image Size Too Large

**Problem**: Docker image > 500MB (should be 100-300MB)

**Solutions**:

1. **Use slim base images**:
   ```dockerfile
   FROM python:3.13-slim     # ~150MB
   FROM python:3.13          # ~900MB
   FROM debian:12-slim       # ~80MB
   FROM debian:12            # ~100MB
   ```

2. **Clean up package managers**:
   ```dockerfile
   RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl \
       && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*  # Remove apt cache
   ```

3. **Multi-stage builds**:
   ```dockerfile
   FROM python:3.13-slim as builder
   COPY requirements.txt .
   RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

   FROM python:3.13-slim
   COPY --from=builder /usr/local/lib/python3.13 /usr/local/lib/python3.13
   ```

4. **Don't include unnecessary files**:
   ```
   .dockerignore:
   __pycache__
   .pytest_cache
   .git
   *.pyc
   node_modules
   ```

### Version & Naming Issues

#### Wrong Tag Created

**Problem**: Image tagged as `latest` instead of `vX.X.X`

**Cause**: Release workflow metadata logic

**Solutions**:

1. **Check branch**: Must be on main branch for `beta-` tags
   ```bash
   git branch -a
   git checkout main
   ```

2. **Check .version**: Must match semver format `X.Y.Z`
   ```bash
   cat .version
   echo "1.2.3" > .version
   ```

3. **Verify release exists**: Pre-release already created
   ```bash
   gh release list
   gh release view vX.X.X
   ```

4. **Manually tag if needed**:
   ```bash
   git tag -a vX.X.X -m "Release X.X.X"
   git push origin vX.X.X
   ```

#### Pre-Release Not Created

**Problem**: Updated `.version` but pre-release not created

**Causes**:

1. **On wrong branch**: version-release.yml only triggers on `main`
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   echo "1.2.4" > .version
   git add .version && git commit -m "Bump version" && git push
   ```

2. **Version is 0.0.0**: Skipped intentionally
   ```bash
   echo "1.0.0" > .version  # Use real version
   ```

3. **Release already exists**: Not created again
   ```bash
   gh release delete vX.X.X  # Delete if needed
   git push origin --delete vX.X.X  # Delete tag
   # Then update .version and commit again
   ```

4. **Workflow failed**: Check GitHub Actions logs
   ```bash
   # View workflow runs
   gh run list --workflow=version-release.yml

   # View failed run details
   gh run view [run-id] --log
   ```

### Permission & Authentication Issues

#### Cannot Push to Registry

**Problem**: Build fails with authentication error

**Cause**: GITHUB_TOKEN doesn't have permission or expired

**Solution**:

1. **Check repository settings**:
   - Settings → Actions → General
   - "Workflow permissions" should be "Read and write permissions"

2. **Verify authentication step**:
   ```yaml
   - name: Log in to Container Registry
     uses: docker/login-action@v3
     with:
       registry: ghcr.io
       username: ${{ github.actor }}
       password: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}  # Should work with runner token
   ```

3. **Test token manually**:
   ```bash
   echo ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} | docker login ghcr.io -u ${{ github.actor }} --password-stdin
   ```

#### Release Creation Fails

**Problem**: "Failed to create release"

**Cause**: Missing permissions or token issue

**Solution**:

1. **Check permissions**:
   ```yaml
   permissions:
     contents: write  # Required for release creation
   ```

2. **Verify GITHUB_TOKEN is available**:
   ```bash
   # This should work in workflow
   env:
     GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
   ```

3. **Check release doesn't already exist**:
   ```bash
   gh release view "vX.X.X"
   ```

### Slow Builds

#### Build Takes Too Long

**Problem**: Workflow takes 20+ minutes

**Solutions** (in order):

1. **Check path filters** (most common):
   - Missing `.version` causes unnecessary rebuilds
   - Verify only needed paths trigger workflow

2. **Check cache is working**:
   ```yaml
   cache-from: type=gha
   cache-to: type=gha,mode=max
   ```
   - First build slow (no cache) - expected
   - Subsequent builds use cache (faster) - expected

3. **Optimize Dockerfile**:
   - Move expensive operations after stable layers
   - Remove unnecessary dependencies
   - Use multi-stage builds

4. **Check test suite**:
   - Long-running tests block build job
   - Consider parallelizing tests across jobs
   - Only run unit tests (not integration tests)

5. **Check dependencies**:
   - Large dependency sets slow pip/npm/go install
   - Review requirements for unused packages
   - Pin specific versions to avoid lengthy resolution

## Project-Specific Configuration

### Service Registry

**Project Template Services**:

| Service | Language | Path | Tests | Security | Notes |
|---------|----------|------|-------|----------|-------|
| flask-backend | Python | `services/flask-backend/` | pytest | bandit, safety check | Python 3.13, Flask, PyDAL |
| go-backend | Go | `services/go-backend/` | go test | gosec, go mod audit | Go 1.23, high-performance networking |
| webui | Node.js | `services/webui/` | jest | npm audit | React frontend, Node.js 18+ |

### Custom Variables

**DEFINE THESE** at the top of build workflows:

```yaml
env:
  REGISTRY: ghcr.io
  IMAGE_NAME: ${{ github.repository }}/[service-name]
  [SERVICE_SPECIFIC_VAR]: value
```

### Environment Variables

**Required at build time**:

| Variable | Source | Usage | Example |
|----------|--------|-------|---------|
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | GitHub | Registry auth, release creation | Auto-provided |
| `DB_TYPE` | Config | Database driver selection | `postgres`, `mysql` |
| `RELEASE_MODE` | Config | License enforcement | `true`/`false` |

### Custom Workflows

**If needed, create project-specific workflows**:

```
.github/workflows/
├── build-flask-backend.yml
├── build-go-backend.yml
├── build-webui.yml
├── [project-name]-special-ci.yml    # Project-specific
└── version-release.yml
```
